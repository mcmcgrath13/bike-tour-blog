After going to bed last night at about 8:30, I woke up this morning at a leisurely 7:30. I enjoyed lounging in a soft bed for a while, but after poking around the kitchen a bit yesterday, I knew I could make French toast this morning, so did not dawdle toooo long. I made a latte and French toast and did the crossword and it was glorious.

I made sure to get in plenty of map staring time through the morning. A key aspect of rest days is planning for the coming stretch and today was no different in that regard. I do have more rest days coming, but I’ll be primarily hanging out with Martha, Kyle, Izzy, and Liam. I also took advantage of the down time to do all the laundry - even my sleeping bag!

Having taken the time to become human again, I popped a bag of popcorn and watched “Come From Away” on the TV. Very luxurious. 

Then it was time to head off to the campground and actually see Martha and Kyle. It was a three hour drive (you can go so fast in a car!), plus I ran a couple errands along the way, so I arrived shortly after seven. Joanna and Danny are here tonight. It was nice to see Joanna again after meeting her when Martha was in med school, and fun meeting Danny, her husband.

We hung out by the fire in camp chairs (with backs!) all evening chatting. The stars are absolutely beautiful.
