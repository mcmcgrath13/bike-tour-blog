On paper, today was supposed to be our easiest day of the trip: only 40 or so miles, flat, on bike path the whole time. In practice, today was tougher than anticipated: it rained all day, the rain made the path really soft - making for slow, muddy, tedious riding.

## The Good News

- John and Susan sent us off this morning well fueled for the day. They put out quite a spread of fruit, yogurt, bagels, and quiche - all delicious!
- We found a great coffee shop right on the path in Pittsford with a covered porch where I enjoyed a cappuccino instead of my usual coffee as we had time to spend avoiding the rain
- There were lots of other touring cyclists out on the canal
- An REI was right on the path (brilliant location!) and I was able to get a fresh fuel canister for my stove
- Above average wildlife spotting today:
  - Chipmunks
  - Rabbits
  - Squirrels
  - Dogs on walks
  - A huge turtle (the shell was a foot long)
  - A doe and a very young fawn
  - Two great blue herons, one shockingly close up
  - Goslings all cuddled up protecting each other from the rain
- We arrived to our hosts for the night (Bill and Sharon) right before it started really pouring. Weâ€™re able to dry out all of our things, take hot showers, were fed a delicious dinner, plus we get to sleep inside out of the rain!
