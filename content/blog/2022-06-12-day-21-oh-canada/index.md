Five states down, nine-ish to go! I’ve made it to Canada 🇨🇦🍁🏒!

I hitched a ride with my parents this morning to the start of the Rainbow Bridge (didn’t feel a deep need to backtrack north and do that ride). I had to cross the border through the car lane for reasons I don’t fully understand. Which is a bummer as the view was stunning and I couldn’t stop and take it in (or take a picture). 

I then headed a bit off route north to meet my friend Kevin for breakfast in the old downtown Niagara. It clearly was the center of town back when trains were in their hey day and before the falls became a huge tourist attraction. I got a giant pile of food to fuel me for much of the day. Thiago, my colleague from Relational AI, then met up with us there and we walked around a little and Kevin saw us off as we headed south past the falls and into the depths of southern Ontario. 

Thiago is just biking with me today and then will head home tomorrow morning. It was fun getting to know him as we were on bike path for a lot of the day and able to chat. He’s a really strong rider so I spent a fair chunk of the ride drafting behind him as we headed into a headwind. 

We ran into an older gentleman on a fixed speed bike as we headed out of Lake Colbourne in the afternoon and ended up riding with him for quite a few miles and were able to replenish our water supply at his cottage. 

Dunville was the destination for dinner tonight before hitting the campground a town over. We found. Great pub with outdoor seating, but it was going to be an hour wait for food. We sadly abandoned our table and wandered down to the A&W a few blocks away instead. Also delicious, but not quite the same. 

We’re camping tonight in a conservation area, then will  part ways in the morning as I continue west and Thiago doubles back east to his car and then home to Waterloo.
