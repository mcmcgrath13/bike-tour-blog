Riding through the Adirondacks smells soooo gooood. It’s so piney. 

## Will Bike for French Toast

After having a super comfy night at the Long View Lodge, we were craving yet another comfort: French Toast. The closest diner was about 10 miles into the day and slightly off route, but very much worth it. We were the only ones there, so we got to chat with the chef and servers who were super nice (though confused as to why anyone would want to bike this far…). 

The rest of the ride was rolling hills with lots of glimpses of lakes and lots and lots of pine trees. 

We came along a bike store in Inlet, which was good timing as my gloves had torn and I was able to pick up a new pair. I also finally convinced my mom to get a good rear bike light (with the help of the store owner). Now I just need to remind her to use and charge it. 

At the supermarket in Old Forge (the largest town we’ve seen in days!), we were able to stock up on food. Then we headed to the camp ground, which turned out to be a bit more off route and uphill than anticipated, but it’s beautiful and quiet with good services, so well worth it. 

We were flip flopping on whether to take a rest day tomorrow or the day after, but then my calf became unusually tight, so decided to play it safe and rest tomorrow (lots of stretching on the docket for me). Three days of mountain riding makes for weary legs.
