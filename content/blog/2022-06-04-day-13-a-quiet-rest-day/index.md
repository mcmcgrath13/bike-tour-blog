Today was a day for reading, stretching, napping, and massaging my calf. We built a fire in the morning to toast our English muffins, had leftover rotisserie chicken (thanks to our campsite neighbors with an RV with a fridge!) and cheesey Chex mix concoctions, and mashed potatoes with spinach and tuna. No one starved. 

Tomorrow we head out on the road again, to our first Warm Showers host of the trip!
