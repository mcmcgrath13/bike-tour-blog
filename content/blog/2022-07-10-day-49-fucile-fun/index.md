I’ve been hanging out with the Fucile clan in New Prague (pronounced “New Praig”). Katie and Sam are at a wedding, so their sons Grayson and Ben are here for the weekend too - lots of cousins!!

The morning tradition here is coffee on the back deck. Kat and Bryce are working on launching a brand, so lots of brainstorming and deciding on logos. Bryce then cooked up a big pile of delicious breakfast. 

I borrowed a car to run some errands during the day. After the heel came detached from my shoe, it was time to track down a new pair. I went to REI and they had a pair I liked - phew. I also picked up a new emergency blanket there as my current one has seen better days. Then on to Dick’s to get swim goggles for the kids. I got groceries on the way back to the house so am now well stocked for when I get back on the road. 

The afternoon was largely spent hanging out by the pool as the kids swam. I got my new bike shoes set up and re-did the duct tape holding together one of my fender spokes. 

After dinner, we all piled into the car and went to Dairy Queen for treats. When we got home I passed out flopped on the bed with the light still on. (Hence the delayed post today)
