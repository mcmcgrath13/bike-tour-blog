Two states down, 13ish to go. 

Cake is one of my favorite breakfast treats, so starting today with cupcakes made for an auspicious morning (thanks Susan!!). We had a long day today, so got up and out around 7am with an escort from Matthew and Christopher on their dirt bikes. 

We were a bit nervous about the route today since it’s just google maps and a bit less reliable than a dedicated bike route. For the most part, it turned out to be beautiful riding through the rolling hills of RI, CT, and MA and ended with 10 miles of mostly downhill bike path into Northampton. 

I haven’t been to Northampton since pre-pandemic. It was fun walking around town and seeing what has changed and what hasn’t. We visited a few of my old haunts and generally enjoyed poking around by foot (a nice change after 78 miles on the bike). 

My college hockey friend Allie is hosting us tonight.  Catching up and reminiscing is always a treat.
