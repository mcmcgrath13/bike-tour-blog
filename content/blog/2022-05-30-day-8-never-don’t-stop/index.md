When Lexi and I toured the pacific coast in 2017, we ran across the phrase “never don’t stop” and it became our mantra for bike touring. I’ve carried that with me into this tour and today was a very strong Never Don’t Stop day. 

We didn’t have too many miles to cover today to get to Fernando and Randy’s house in Shelburne, VT, so had plenty of time to stop and poke around. We started with breakfast sandwiches a couple miles out from the campground, then took a leisurely coffee and scone stop in Vergennes, then the food looked so good there that we ended up staying for lunch too… Along the route, we stumbled upon an open studio and popped in to check out the art and got some snacks and postcards to boot. We topped off the afternoon with a visit to the Shelburne Museum where we rode the carousel, talked to the blacksmith, explored an old steamship, and of course lay on the grass under a shady tree.

Our long anticipated stopping point for the evening is Randy and Fernando’s (and Kody and Eggsy’s) house in Shelburne. Fernando grilled up delicious pizza and we hung out on his deck enjoying the beautiful weather. A great end to a great day. 

We’re taking a rest day here before heading out of VT and over to NY where we’ll start crossing the Adirondack Mountains.
