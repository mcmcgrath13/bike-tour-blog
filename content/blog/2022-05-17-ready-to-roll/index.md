Well, Iâ€™ve acquired everything on my packing list, logged over 500 training miles and there are 5 days until tires are dipped in the Atlantic. So I guess Iâ€™m ready to roll?

## The Plan

My mom and I will dip our tires in the Atlantic on Sunday 5/22 and start heading northwest. Sheâ€™ll be with me until Buffalo, NY where weâ€™ll be visiting family and celebrating my birthday ðŸ¥³. After that, Iâ€™ll head solo into Canada and across to Michigan, over the Upper Peninsula (probably, thereâ€™s an alternate thatâ€™s shorter if need be) and then more or less straight west to Anacortes, WA. My friend MJ, who I met when touring the pacific coast in 2017, will be joining up with me in Glacier National Park and then biking over the Rockies to the end.

Iâ€™ll have full camping gear with me, so camping will be my default sleeping option. However, I plan to visit friends and family along the way, as well as stay at the occasional Warm Showers host or motel.
