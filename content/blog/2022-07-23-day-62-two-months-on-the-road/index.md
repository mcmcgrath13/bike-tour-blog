Today marks two months of bike touring (and also my brotherâ€™s birthday - happy birthday JM ðŸ¥³)! My sense of time is pretty warped these days as Iâ€™m experiencing so many new things each day and the landscape changes so continuously. It feels like Iâ€™ve been on the road for a long time, but itâ€™s also hard to believe Iâ€™m now much closer to the end than the beginning. Time is weird.

## Morning Miles

The forecast for today was very hot and quite headwindy, so I got up at dawn to try to get as much of my riding done before the weather turned against me. The landscape turned from pretty flat to rolling today and also with a lot more badland than farm. I enjoy rollers, so with the quiet roads, cool air, and scenic views, this morningâ€™s riding was a lot of fun. 

I stopped at the only thing along the route today, a rest stop with some bathrooms and water and shade. I chatted with a family en route to Great Falls who may even see me again when they drive back (cars are so fast!). 

I knew that there might be some road construction today, but man was it worse than I expected. The road was torn up and what was left was really loose, big gravel. Bubba is not cut out for that. I started walking and hoping a car would come by and help me out. It took many minutes (very quiet road) and a few tries, but eventually Dean pulled over with his trailer and gave me a ride through the construction. Heâ€™s hauls small loads around the country and is trying to get to every state with his truck (even Hawaii). Heâ€™s got a little toy dozer strapped to the back of his trailer that he takes photos of in the cool spots he gets to explore along the way. He even sent me off with some cold water which was a treat as the temps were quickly rising. 

The last twenty or so miles into Jordan felt like biking in a blow dryer. Hot, dry, headwinds really slowed me down. With the help of a starburst every few miles, I made it to Jordan in time for lunch. 

I checked out most of the town today it seems. One of the bars for lunch, the library, the post office, the general store, the grocery store, the hardware store, and finally the park where Iâ€™m camping. 

Another cyclist is here tonight! Avner is headed east and gave me lots of great tips on the road ahead and good places to stay along the way.
