After a great sleep in a very comfortable bed with soft-but-not-too-soft pillows, Noel and I were ready to explore Fargo today. We went back downtown to the “Greetings from Fargo” mural and then wandered from there. We quickly stumbled upon a farmers market where we each found some brunch: Nigerian pancakes and plantains for Noel, a Vietnamese noodle salad for me. We wanders a bit further and ended up hanging out in a bicycle themed coffee shop for a while. 

We headed out to the county fairgrounds to check out Bonanzaville next. Bonanzaville is a local history museum and village with old timey buildings, cars, trains, and airplanes. It was fun to learn more of the history of Fargo and North Dakota. 

It was back to downtown for lunch at a cool würst/beer hall. I had truly excellent Mac and cheese made with spaetzel. I need to learn to emulate it when I get home. After lunch, it was off to Scheel’s to stock up on some camping gear. As we’re getting closer to the Rockies, we both picked up a can of bear spray for our respective adventures. 

We took a brief respite back at the hotel for a while. It was hot and humid out there today. Very glad to be resting and not biking in this. There are a lot of restaurants around Fargo. We eventually settled on a Mexican place a few blocks away and it turned out excellent. We both got enchiladas with rice and beans and a short margarita (only $2!). 

Tomorrow, we want to check out a museum that was closed today and then it’s off west to Dickinson.
