The temperature today got into the 90‚Äôs with a feels like in the 100‚Äôs. Great day for a hotel rest day in the AC. 

I took full advantage of the buffet breakfast (though no waffle maker üôÅ): scrambled eggs, sausage, cinnamon raisin bagel, yogurt with granola, coffee, and chocolate milk. 

Main activities for the day were watching First Lady, listening to podcasts, catching up on the crossword, writing post cards, fixing a bike tube, and making some plans for the coming week. 

From my consulting days, I still have a pile of Marriott points, which I‚Äôll be taking advantage of the next few days as there are reasonably priced (pointed?) properties near the route and at good stopping points. I‚Äôll be living the inn-to-inn bike touring lifestyle for a few days - how fancy! Then back to camping.
