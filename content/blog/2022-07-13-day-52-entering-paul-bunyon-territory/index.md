As I entered Brainerd today, there was a photo op at the visitor center with a Paul Bunyon statue, and then a mile later I turned onto the Paul Bunyon Trail. I guess this is Paul Bunyon Territory. Legend has it his giant footsteps created all the lakes here.

## Criss-crossing the Mississippi 

I had an easy morning in my tent, but as soon as I left it I had to rush as the mosquitoes were on me right away. I got up, lounged, then out as soon as possible. 

I headed a little off route to go into town (river crossing #1 and back #2) as I saw a coffee roaster on google maps. I arrived to Reality Roasters Coffee Co and the woman working asked if I was looking for coffee to drink. I said I was. She replied that she couldn’t sell me coffee, but she could give me brewed coffee for free and I happily accepted. Business rules are weird sometimes. I ended up staying and chatting with her for almost an hour while sipping a very delicious cup of coffee. She sent me off with a full to go mug to boot. 

I then continued north along quiet roads to the west of the Mississippi. At Camp Ripley, an army outpost, I had to cross back to the east side of the Mississippi (crossing #3) and rode on and off of highway 371 until Brainerd. 

There was a visitor center right on the highway that toted a gift shop, photo op with Paul Bunyon, and bathrooms, so I decided to check it out. As I was reading some of the displays about Minnesota and the region, several people approached me asking about my trip, noting they’d passed me on the road in. 

From the visitor center, I turned into a state park and got on the Paul Bunyon State Trail. The path was pretty quiet and wound its way along the Mississippi north. The route was a little turny through/around Brainerd and I ended up crossing the Mississipi for the fourth time of the day. After that, the path took me north through woods and by lakes. 

I arrived to my mom’s friend Enette’s house in the afternoon. She spends the summers up here with her family at their cabin on the lake. She kindly offered to have me for a couple nights so I could rest and take advantage of the kayaking and paddle boarding, which I happily accepted. Due to festivals in Fargo this weekend causing everything to be booked up, I need to slow down a bit so I can have a place to stay when I arrive.
