We made it to our first Great Lake! Lake Ontario is very large, which feels oceany, but there are no waves and the seagulls are smaller. 

We started the day with John cooking us a delicious breakfast of bantam chicken eggs (they’re petite!), sausage and toast with homemade strawberry jam. Anne was kind enough to send us off with some cookies for later. All in all, a great start to the day. 

Our coffee stop was at a small diner in Port Ontario (though no view of the lake yet). Then we continued on through rolling hills through the progressively larger small towns along the shore. 

We found a restaurant with a great deck overlooking a lock on the Oswego River to take our lunch break at. We had delicious garlic cheddar biscuits and steak and cheese sandwiches while we watched a few boats go through. I met a man and his dog who had just been through the lock, and he said this one of the deepest there is and that when you’re at the bottom it’s like your in an alley staring up at tall buildings on either side. 

Eventually, we made it to Fair Haven where we finally hit the shore and saw the lake. We got ice cream treats to celebrate and sat on a breakwater enjoying them and admiring the view. There are these big bluffs along the shore, which I wouldn’t have expected on a lake. 

It’s my mom’s last camp dinner of the trip: ramen in a peanut sauce with snow peas and a chopped kale bagged salad with poppyseed dressing. Not a bad dessert to our ice cream dinner.
