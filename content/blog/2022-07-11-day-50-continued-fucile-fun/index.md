Today was hot and windy and thunder stormy, so I chose to spend another day hanging out with the Fucile clan and will get back on the road tomorrow. 

After morning coffee on the back deck and another delicious breakfast, we all piled in the car and went to Fleet Farm. Fleet Farm is huuuuuuge - it has all of the things: camping gear, groceries, car tires, clothes, horse stuff, kitchen appliances, etc. As Kit prepared me, there’s nothing like this back east. We got Grayson some fishing gear for his birthday next week (🎉🎂), a couple horse things, and some much needed new shoes for Ben (he had managed to wear through the toe of his old pair). 

On the way back home, we stopped at Von Hanson’s, a local meat store, as Kit wanted to get me some good local jerky for my travels (thank you!). She also picked up some snacks for the rest of the ride home as everyone needed some food. 

After lunch time, Bryce hooked me up with a new spoke holder widget. He saw my duct tape and rubber band solution yesterday, and knew he could do better. He built one in the shop in the barn and we got it all set up. It’s so shiny and should work much better and longer than my old set up.

Sam and Katie got back a bit later and picked up Grayson, Ben, and Dixie (🐶) and I got to say a quick hello/goodbye. Things quieted down for the rest of the afternoon with lots of reading time.

Kit and John cooked up a South Carolina low country boil for dinner. It had sausage, shrimp, corn, potatoes, onion, and delicious Cajun spices. It was so good. I ate so much I didn’t have room for s’mores after dinner. However, Avaya had her first s’more! It was a bit of a mess, but she definitely enjoyed it.
