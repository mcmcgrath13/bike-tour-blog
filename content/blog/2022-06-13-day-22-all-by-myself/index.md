I bid farewell to Thiago early this morning and am now riding solo. Given this, expect fewer photos of me and more landscapes/things. 

There was a chance of rain in the forecast this morning and boy did it find me. It was rather wet for much of the morning. I struck out on finding coffee as a lot was closed on Sundays, however, I got some chocolate milk and found some covered steps to sit on and rest for a bit. Due to the wet, I found/fixed a really slowly leaking flat, as I could hear it hissing when I stopped. Iâ€™m relieved that mystery was solved. 

Pretty decent headwinds today. Without Thiago to draft behind, it was definitely slower going. But all I have to do all day is bike! So slow is not a problem, just takes a bit longer to get where Iâ€™m going. 

I stopped in Port Dover for lunch at an old school hot dog/burger joint with picnic tables alongside it. The rain had stopped by then, so it was nice to rest and dry off for a bit. 

The scenery today has been beautiful. Iâ€™m biking along Lake Erie and there are lots of farms, lake houses, woods, and marshes. The roads have been pretty quiet, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s quite the season here yet. 

Iâ€™m camping at a family campground tonight that is more RV heavy. Thereâ€™s a section for tenters, but Iâ€™m the only one in it. Got my pick of sites, so that was nice.
