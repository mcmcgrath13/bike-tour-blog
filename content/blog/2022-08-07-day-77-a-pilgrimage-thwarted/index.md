I woke up early and convinced myself to leave my cozy sleeping bag and bike in the chilly morning air all for naught. I got to the ACA headquarters with plenty of time to spare before the Saturday summer hours of 9-1 that I found somewhere online (and canâ€™t find anymoreâ€¦ maybe summer is over?), but no one was home. I may try again later.

The bad road conditions from the end of yesterday only lasted a few more miles which was a relief. Once I got to route 200 (my old friend from eastern Montana), the shoulder was huge and wel paved. Very easy riding from there to Missoula. The route wound alongside a river towards the city. It went over some hills, but down more than up, which is always nice. 

After my ACA visit was thwarted, I wandered around the craft market nearby and found a cafe for a treat and some coffee. The shop looked small from the outside, but once you step in you realize itâ€™s a vast space with tons of tables. I hung there for a bit then went on to Big Dipper ice cream which Lexi said I must try while in town. 

Big Dipper is the only place besides Grayâ€™s in Tiverton that Iâ€™ve ever seen offer Mocha Chip ice cream. I asked for a taste to see how it compared, but it was no Grayâ€™s. I went with a vanilla cake milkshake instead, which had nice cake batter-y vibes. 

My cousin lives a bit out of town, so I wandered through the city and out to the edge of the foothills. Google Maps said the route was mostly flat, which it was until it wasnâ€™t. I should know by now not to trust its elevation stats. 

After cleaning up, I enjoyed hanging out with Rob and Pam on their excellent deck with a great view over the Clark Fork river valley and the mountains beyond. Pam cooked up some great pasta with veggies and shrimp, which was so tasty. We then hung out playing Rummikub, which I havenâ€™t played in years. 

Tomorrow, weâ€™re going to go on a river float, which sounds like itâ€™ll be quite an adventure.
