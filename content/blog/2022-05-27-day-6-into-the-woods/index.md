Tonight is our first night camping. Itâ€™s supposed to rain, weâ€™ll find out if my tent is still waterproof!

## A Very Pleasant Ride

Todayâ€™s ride was quite relaxing. Because of logistics of where to camp, we didnâ€™t need to go very far today, then the ride was mostly downhill and with a tailwind to boot! We biked along a river all day and passed lots of farms. It was very idyllic Vermont.

We met some nice people over morning coffee who had themselves done some touring. They also knew the area well and were able to give us some good tips. 

Weâ€™re well stocked on food after a visit to the supermarket. For our first camp meal we made chicken and dumplings, which turned out quite delicious!
