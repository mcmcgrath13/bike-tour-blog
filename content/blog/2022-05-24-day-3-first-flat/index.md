Welp, got my first flat. It looks like a bit of a nail/staple pierced the tire. Thankfully the spot it happened was a great place to pull over and fix it and not the very busy road we ran into two miles later. 

## Hills (Mountains?)

We climbed two big lumps of earth today on our way west through the Berkshires. We knew today would have a lot more hills than we‚Äôre used to, so purposefully kept the mileage a little lower. Thankfully, the grades were mostly gentle with only a few steeper sections. 

We went through some great little towns dotting the hills of Western Mass. The coffee stop was at a diner in Williamsburg, lunch in Goshen, a chocolate milk from the cow themed co-op in Cummington, a really good homemade samosa from the general store in Windsor, a flat tire in Dalton, and staying the night in Pittsfield with my Mom‚Äôs friend (Peter and Jerri). 

Peter is a professional chef, so I‚Äôm looking forward to dinner!
