In bike touring, there are three broad categories of support: self supported, van supported, and inn to inn. My trip would be categorized as self supported (full camping gear, haul all your own stuff). However, the past few days Iâ€™ve been self supporting myself from inn to inn. It feels very luxurious: comfy bed, lots of pillows, big hot breakfast, hot shower, air conditioning, a roof, oh my. 

This morning, I woke up well rested after having fallen asleep before the sun even set last night (I was exhausted ðŸ˜´). I went and ate the hotel buffet breakfast, then went back and lounged in bed a bit before meandering out a bit after 9. 

Yesterday, I used my last tube patch and I had half a spare tube on me (one Iâ€™d patched/repatched, but didnâ€™t fully trust. So I was just hoping and hoping that Iâ€™d make it the 25 miles to the bike store in bay city. Thankfully, I did. Bubba now has a new, heavier-duty front tire and Iâ€™ve got two fresh spare tubes and lots of patches. Maybe this will ward off the flat tire demons. 

At the bike shop, I was chatting with one of the guys there and he  recommended a different route to Midway than the one ACA sends you. It was a bit more direct and he said the shoulder was better and it was his preferred route there. I took his word and headed west (after a leisurely picnic lunch in the park across the way). The road was very quiet and overall a nice ride (though there was a road closure I snuck around at one point). This route led me to a bike path into town and by lots of Dow properties. It seems Midland is a company town and that company is the Dow chemical company. 

The route change also saved me a few miles, which I didnâ€™t mind as the headwinds were still really strong today. It looks like theyâ€™ll break and shift tomorrow ðŸ¤ž.
