Iâ€™ve officially rotated around the sun 31 times! And as a bonus, I got to celebrate that surrounded by family.

Overall, it was a quiet, but very good day (Iâ€™m not a big birthday person). Aunt Joannie and Uncle Gary had a wedding to go to tonight, so we celebrated with them last night with a delicious homemade dinner and a couple games of Quiddler. Then today, I had a peaceful morning sipping coffee and doing the crossword, figuring out logistics for heading into Canada tomorrow, going grocery shopping, eating strawberry shortcake, and then getting takeout Pakistani food for dinner. As a bonus, the wedding ended a bit early and I was able to see my cousin Molly and her daughter Shaelyn!

When I was figuring out my route forever ago, one of the things I most liked about the route I chose was that I could visit my family in Buffalo, and over my birthday no less. I didnâ€™t get to see all the cousins, but itâ€™s been so nice catching up with those I have seen and getting lots of updates on everyone else from Aunt Joannie. Aunt Joannie and Uncle Gary have been amazing hosts for the past couple of days and Iâ€™m very much looking forward to one more of Joannieâ€™s morning fruit salads before I head back on the road tomorrow.
