Today was our biggest climbing day yet. About 4000â€™ total and we ended the day up about 800â€™ from where we started. It was a very satisfying climb overall - not too steep and good lookbacks to see how far up youâ€™d gone. 

## Bugs as Motivation

It turns out light rain makes the black flies come out of the trees and bother the humans. So while the rain wasnâ€™t that bad, the bugs were relentless. They were very good motivation to keep biking as at those speeds they couldnâ€™t bother you as much.

We made it to Long Lake and were stopped at the main intersection contemplating whether to head two miles off route to the campground or two miles on route to a lodge. With the rain pattering away and the bugs bugging away, we decided to head to the lodge.

The lodge also has a great restaurant. So we treated ourselves to dinner out. My mom just found out she won a fancy award in her field, so we turned it into a celebration ðŸ¥³
