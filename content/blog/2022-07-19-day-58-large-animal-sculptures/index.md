Giant animal sculptures seem to be a thing in this part of the world. We visited Dakota Thunder (buffalo) and New Salem Sue (cow) and I think we also might have passed a giant great blue heron somewhere along the way. 

## Road Tripping

This morning, Bubba got packed into the back of the car and we headed downtown for breakfast. We found breakfast burritos at a taco shop and then went next door for coffee. There’s a nice plaza in town with tables and chairs by a green which we ate at. It wasn’t yet hot out. 

The Plains Museum opened at eleven and we got there a few minutes after. There were a few exhibits open along with a local watercolor contest along the hallways. I particularly enjoyed the exhibit exploring light and color in different media. 

Once we were done exploring the museum, we started heading west. First up was Jamestown, home of Dakota Thunder. After visiting him we found a Seattle themed cafe downtown for lunch (it was one of few non-chains in town, so still local?). We also picked up groceries and snacks since we passed right by a supermarket. 

New Salem Sue was a short visit to say hello and see the view from her hill. It was hoooot out. From there it was about an hour to the hotel in Dickinson. We got settled and enjoyed flopping on hotel beds (never gets old) then went to Phat Fish Brewery downtown to try a flight of beers and get some food.

Somewhere along the way we switched time zones again, so gotta get used to that. Tomorrow is a hiking day at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. First National Park of the trip!
