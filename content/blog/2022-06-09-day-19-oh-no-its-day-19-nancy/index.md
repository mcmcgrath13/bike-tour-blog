While many 71-year-olds might be thrilled to know their 816-mile bike tour has ended, my body is ready and willing to go on to Seattle. Mary's route through the Berkshires, Green Mountains, and Adirondacks certainly whipped us into shape. I feel stronger than ever â€” and am now fearless of biking through hills and headwinds. 

To my dismay, life is calling me back to the "real world." I have happily escaped it for the past 18 days.  I am left with wonderful memories of a mother-daughter bonding experience, a scenic bike tour, and fun times sharing thousands of yummy calories. We sure did have enjoy eating lots of good tasting (though not always good-for-optimal health) food!!!

Mary, I send you off on your next chapter with my best wishes for meeting up with interesting travel companions, tailwinds, and a safe and scenic journey. I will be with you in spirit and will enjoy reading your blog for the next chapters in your tour. Do remember to keep fueling wisely (hahaha) and have fun pedaling onward! 

With love, Mom
