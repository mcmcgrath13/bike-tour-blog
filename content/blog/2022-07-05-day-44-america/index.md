Happy 4th of July!!

This morning we got the campsite cleaned and packed up and headed back up north to Hayward. I hung out in the back seat with Liam and Izzy making sure everyone was/was not sleeping, eating snacks, and generally not miserable. We started to fall apart in the last few minutes, but made it home without incident. 

Much of the afternoon was spent recovering from camping: bathing, laundry, unloading things, cleaning. 

I cooked dinner tonight. I got the lasagna recipe from Aunt Googie and headed off to the grocery store in the afternoon to get the ingredients. It turned out almost as good as hers! I made a salad and garlic bread to go with it. Definitely a meal that reminded me of home. It was also nice to cook something involving multiple pots and pans and chopping stuff - camp cooking is a very different beast. 

After dinner and the kids were put to bed, Martha and Kyle and I got in a game of Wingspan. Kyle won, as per usual. He has quite a collection of games, so itâ€™s always fun to see what he has and learn new games from him.
