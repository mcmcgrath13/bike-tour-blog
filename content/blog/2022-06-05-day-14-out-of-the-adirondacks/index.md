We officially left the Adirondacks today ðŸ‘‹â›°. They were gorgeous and will be missed - our legs are stronger for them. 

Weâ€™re now down and headed towards the Great Lakes. Though we had quite a headwind today, so that mostly negated the fact that we went down about a net 1000â€™.

The weather was cool and sunny today, which made for very pretty riding. Just slow going with the wind. Good thing all we need to do all day is bike (and eat)! Speaking of, we found a great country store in Boonville that had a huge assortment of food and snacks and treats. We both got quesadillas with the works, I got a coffee, and we picked up some extra treats for the road. 

Our destination for the night is the home of John and Anne, Warm Showers hosts in Richland. (Warm Showers is a network of touring cyclists who host each other.) They generously fed us a delicious dinner and dessert, let us use their shower, and even do a load of laundry. They have a beautiful garden and yard, where weâ€™re camping for the night. Theyâ€™ve been great company and itâ€™s always fun to get to know other bike tourers. 

Tomorrow, we hit our first great lake: Lake Ontario.
