Iâ€™ve made a solid dent in my cross country journey - over 3,000 miles. About a thousand more to go before the ocean! If I were biking across the south (which I am very happily not in this summer heat), Iâ€™d have finished a couple hundred miles ago. 

## The Edge

Today I biked along the edge of the plains and the edge of a thunder storm. Tomorrow I head into the mountains and leave the plains (and hopefully no storms ðŸ¤ž). 

I got up on the earlier side as I wanted to check out a coffee shop Iâ€™d seen yesterday and still get most of my miles done before it got hot. I got a latte and a cinnamon roll fresh from the oven. There were great arm chairs to lounge in and lots of plants. I could have happily sat there all day, but knew Iâ€™d regret not biking in the cooler part of the day, so I moved. Eventually. 

There was only one town along the way today, so I stopped in to stock up on groceries and get some lunch. Iâ€™m not sure what the food situation will be in Glacier, so wanted to start pretty well stocked. I got a chocolate milk and tuna sandwich for lunch, which I enjoyed at a shaded picnic table in the park across the street. 

When I was at the grocery store, one of the folks working there got a weather alert about Thurber storms. The skies were getting cloudy, but not ominous, so I hit the road. I occasionally got rained on with massive, cold rain drops, which honestly felt good in contrast to the heat, though ominous. I heard thunder rumbling to my west, but clear skies remained ahead. I got to the junction where I was hoping to head a bit further west and have a shorter day tomorrow, but I couldnâ€™t get a hold of the campground - dead phone - and thatâ€™s the direction of the storms, so I took the sure thing at a campsite a mile off route into town. 

The owner, John, gave me a tour and a beer on my arrival. I was hanging out in the Gazebo when a Swiss couple rolled in on their bikes headed east. We exchanged the usual advice on our respective roads ahead, and then they headed into town for the evening. Iâ€™m pretty tired, so hung back and researched and read. Thereâ€™s also a family staying here with a very bored and talkative teenage son who entertained me for a while. 

Tomorrow, I head into Glacier where Iâ€™ll take a few days to hike and explore. Word on the street is cell service is pretty spotty there, so I may not be posting as regularly.
