Six states done, eight-ish to go!! With the flat roads, slightly higher mileage days, and a tailwind towards the end, Ontario really flew by. 

## Cruising

I got off to an early-ish start this morning, but didnâ€™t make it out of the campground before realizing my front tire was soft (again). I couldnâ€™t find a leak, so just pumped it back up and it seems to be holding ðŸ¤·. I think itâ€™s time for a new front tire at the next bike shop I come across. 

Joanne recommended a bakery in Ridgetown when we were chatting over the fire last night, so I was sure to stop there this morning. I got coffee and an eclair. They had a lot of tasty looking loaves of bread - too bad they pack/travel so poorly. 

The miles were really flying this morning with the tailwind. I made it to the Tim Hortons in Dresden in no time flat, so had a leisurely breakfast sandwich and rest in the shade. I felt obliged to get Tim Hortons while in Canada, so Iâ€™m glad one was on the route today. 

I took the first ferry of the day across to Algonac, MI from Walpole Island. The first ferry happens to be at 2:30 and I got there with time to spare so I found a nearby baseball field with a shady dugout to have second lunch in (first lunch was at a park bench in Wallaceburg). The ferry was nice and short and they let me off the boat first, so I was through customs by 3, which was a pleasant surprise.

I had about 30 miles of biking from the ferry to the hotel for tonight. Much of it was on bike path, but what wasnâ€™t was on relatively busy roads with not ideal shoulders. Thatâ€™s the trade off for being in real towns I suppose. The last couple miles from where I turned off the route  to the hotel were particularly busy (though the cars were all really nice), so Iâ€™m going to try a different route out when I leave.

My brother had two free hotel nights to use by the end of the month that he couldnâ€™t make us of, so Iâ€™m taking advantage and staying at a hotel in Port Huron tonight and tomorrow (rest day). Theyâ€™ve got a big breakfast buffet, which I am very excited about! I ordered pizza for tonight and have some leftover for lunch/dinner/food tomorrow. 

Itâ€™s a good confidence boost that these past few higher mileage days have gone well. I just discovered a typo in my spreadsheet and it turns out I have another 100 miles to do between here and WIâ€¦
