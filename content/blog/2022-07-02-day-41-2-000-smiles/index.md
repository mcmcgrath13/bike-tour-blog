I’ve made it to the spiritual halfway point of the trip: Hayward, WI (the home of Martha Grace and Kyle). The planning of this whole trip was anchored around spending Fourth of July weekend off the road here. I now have four rest days ahead of me. I’ve also cracked 2,000 miles! Not quite half way mile-wise, but getting closer. 

## Back on the Bike

Dan and Jeanne treated me to an excellent breakfast of yogurt with berries and granola, English muffins with homemade grape jelly, and an espresso. Having a good meal under my belt was good as I was a little nervous getting back on the bike this morning after taking a spill yesterday. Dan and Jeanne saw me off as I took my first peddles and the good news is I still remember how to ride a bike. 

The riding today was on gently rolling county roads and highways with a few back roads towards the end. Lots of forest, some lakes, a few rivers, and a couple farms today. As the day went on, both the wind and traffic increased (it is the Friday of Fourth of July weekend after all). Given this, I went much more than I stopped so I could get off the roads mid-afternoon. 

The main stop of the day was in Clam Lake, where I was able to get a chocolate milk to supplement my pita/pb/honey/sriracha and handfuls of granola. Clam lake was also the last town of the day, so I stopped briefly for a side of the road snack twenty miles later, but otherwise rode through the afternoon. 

I arrived to Kyle and Martha Grace’s house outside of Hayward at about 2:45. They already left for camping yesterday and I’ll join them tomorrow or Sunday, so the house was empty. I gave myself a tour, while trying to ask them for the wifi info as my cell service was spotty. It turns out my cell service was a lie, so I took a drive in Martha’s car up to the end of the road and was able to give her a call and catch up, get the wifi password, and also got their mail while I was there. 

Now able to let folks know I made it and all was well, I made myself at home. I took a shower, popped a bag of popcorn (one of my favorite foods), and found a Spotted Cow beer (only sold in WI) and settled in on the couch. I had a lazy afternoon and evening and will start tackling laundry and other logistical todo’s tomorrow.
