It turns out I should have gotten Bubba two new tires yesterday. I was crusing along on a bike path this morning and go over a wooden bridge then hissssssss. Another flat. Upon close inspection, the tireâ€™s tread was coming apart in places. Good thing there was a bike shop in a couple towns and I had all the supplies to fix it (thanks Rayâ€™s bike shop!). 

## Wrong Turns Cause Longer Days

I had another leisurely hotel morning with a big breakfast and got on the road at about nine. The first thirty miles today were all on a really nice bike path. For about ten of those miles I ended up riding and chatting with a retired software engineer, which was nice. 

I got to Clare a bit before noon and first went to the bike shop to fix up Bubba and refill water, then on to grocery shopping. I couldnâ€™t find pita or naan, so I ended up with bagels as my bread for the next few days. Weâ€™ll see how I like it. 

The afternoon was spent riding through lake towns and farmland. I just missed an antique car show in Lake George, but got passed by lots of cool old cars, which was fun. All was going well until I realized I wasnâ€™t quite on route. By about three miles. That tacked on 6 miles to what was supposed to be a 75 mile day. Oh well. 

The campground Iâ€™m at tonight is pretty rustic. The water source is a hand pump! Itâ€™s pretty quiet here tonight - just a few other campers up the road a bit.
