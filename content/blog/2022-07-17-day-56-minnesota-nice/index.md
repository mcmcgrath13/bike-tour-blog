Today was a “Minnesota Nice” day. The riding was beautiful, and when it wasn’t, the people really stepped up and made it great. 

I got up and out on the early side as I had a lot of miles to ride. My tent was wet, but Noel kindly took it in the car after it dried some. The ride out from the campground was through beautiful lakes, woods, and marshes. This extended through to the Tanarac National Wildlife Refuge, after which it was largely farm land and an occasional lake. 

I finally got my Minnesota post cards written and in the mail with a couple towns left to go! I stopped at a cute little town where there was a post office box (not a common sight today) and got them in while enjoying some chocolate milk and baby carrots.

As I biked on, I saw a big grey mass looming on the horizon. Getting closer, I could see the rain sheeting down ahead of me. I pulled off to a grove of trees, but the neighbor dog wouldn’t stop barking at me so I kept going to find better shelter. I spotted a red garage with the door open and lights on so I pulled up the driveway. Two guys were sitting on lawn chairs in the bay and I asked if I could shelter with them and they said yes! It turned into the highlight of the day. Craig and Cole have been working on restoring an old steam engine tractor and had gotten it up and running when the rain started. I learned all about steam engines and farming and the local area. Then when the rain quieted, they gave me a tour and a short ride. It was so cool! Sadly, I had to get back on the road, but as I road off they blew the steam whistle for me. 

Some miles further on, I came to the edge of the Red River Valley. The valley used to be a huge glacial lake, so the edge was the banks of that lake. From the top of the banks you can see forever. I descended slowly down for a few miles into the valley and then the road was pancake flat through farmland until I crossed the Red River into Fargo. I rode through cute residential neighborhoods and blocks with shops as I wound through the city to the hotel. The landscape became more industrial and big box as I went on, but I look forward to going back to downtown tomorrow. 

Noel met me at the hotel and after a bit of rest and showers, we went out to dinner at a ramen/poke place a couple miles away. When you have a car, you can go anywhere for dinner! Not just the places in the immediate vicinity. So fancy. We hung out watching the new season of The Umbrella Academy after dinner and will explore Fargo some more tomorrow. 

P.S. Nine states down! Five-ish to go. North Dakota is the first state I’ve biked into that I haven’t been to ever. It’s the 32nd state I’ve visited in my life.
