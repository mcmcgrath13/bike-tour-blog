It turns out the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend is a great time to have a bake sale. Our morning coffee stop ended up being at a bake sale/craft fair in Fair Haven, and our lunch stop at a bake/plant/book sale in Orwell. Hopefully we run into more bake sales!

# Rain and Rollers

Today, we finally got to test out our rain gear. There were roving storm clouds in the area for a big chunk of the afternoon. Good news - it works! The afternoon was also full of rolling hills through farmland, which was beautiful, though a bit tiring given the strong headwind. 

We made it to our campground on Lake Champlain after strategically ignoring a road closure by just walking around it (bikes are nimble in ways cars are not).  This campground is much grassier than any other I’ve been to, which makes for easy and comfortable tent siting. 

We made peanut noodles with spinach for dinner and now it’s time to read and rest up for tomorrow.
