It continues to be rather hot in the afternoons, so after arriving to Conrad and settling into the RV park, I headed to the city museum for a whirlwind tour before it closed, then on to the library to read in the cool quiet. This library is in an old brick building and has huge windows overlooking the street. I settled into a soft leather couch bookended by big plants and read for a couple hours while I charged my phone and waited for the heat to break. 

## Heading North

I had a feast of a breakfast this morning at the hotel: a big burrito, toasted bagel with cream cheese, Greek yogurt, chocolate milk, and coffee. I then flopped back in bed for a few minutes before packing up and getting back on the road.

I’m headed north today and tomorrow - biking parallel to the Rockies before heading into them on Saturday. The route took me on frontage roads along I-15 all day. Frontage roads have their pros and cons. Pros: I’m not on the highway, cell service tends to be good, towns semi-regularly, gentler hills, not much traffic. Cons: traffic noise, not so scenic, no shoulder. 

Between being well rested and well fed, the miles were pretty easy today. The wind was also quiet and a cross/tail, which doesn’t hurt. 

I stopped in Dutton for a lunch break. I was originally looking for a chocolate milk or other treat to supplement a picnic lunch, but then saw a great looking cafe in town and decided to head there instead. Lily Bean Cafe turned out to be a great stop - good food and good conversation! They have a map on the wall of where people are from - I proudly added the first pin in Rhode Island. 

With more good food in my belly, I headed North to Brady. No great cafe here, but a nice little park with a big shade tree and a picnic table to rest at. From Brady, it was only another twelve miles to Conrad. 

After my library adventure in Conrad, I was getting hungry, but it was still just too hot to cook. There’s a big grocery store next to the RV park so I stopped in on my way back and got some cold foods for a picnic dinner. I got a cream puff, cut watermelon, and some pasta salad, which I ate in that order while sitting in the shade at the park across the way. I then laid in the shade until the heat broke enough to move to my tent for the night.
