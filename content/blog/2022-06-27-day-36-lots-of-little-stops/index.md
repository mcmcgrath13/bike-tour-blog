I went extra long yesterday so today could be a shorter day as I knew the wind would not be favorable. Originally, today was going to be a longer day and yesterday a more normal length, but the wind forecast changed my mind. Riding into a strong headwind is tiring work, so I stopped‚Ä¶ frequently.

Places I stopped:
- Linda‚Äôs Bread Box to get and sip some coffee (and also a package of ramen)
- Cooks‚Äô picnic pavilion behind the community center
- An MDOT rest area
- The side of the road to chat with another touring cyclist going the other way‚ÑπÔ∏è
- The side of the road at Bull Run Creek
- The side of the road near Ensign
- Jack‚Äôs Cafe in Rapid River (this was a less short stop for French toast)
- A supermarket in Gladstone
- A lakefront park in Gladstone
- On a short bike path to chat with a cyclist going the other way‚ÑπÔ∏è

As you can see, I averaged about five miles between stops. It was one of those days.

However, I made it to Dan and Karin‚Äôs house in Escanaba! They are friends of Ann and Cindy from Traverse City and are kindly hosting me tonight and tomorrow. They fed me a delicious dinner and dessert (Happy Birthday Karin ü•≥), we spent some time looking at maps (a touring cyclist‚Äôs main pastime), and I enjoyed sitting in their front room overlooking a park right on the lake. I‚Äôm definitely going to enjoy a cup of coffee there tomorrow morning. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è Both cyclists were doing a loop of Lake Michigan, one from Chicago and the other from Milwaukee. However, very different touring styles: one was going about 60 miles a day from inn to inn and the other was going about 150 miles a day and camping.
