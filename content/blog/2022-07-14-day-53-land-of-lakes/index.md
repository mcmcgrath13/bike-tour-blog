While I have passed many lakes in my journey, I haven’t really gotten to enjoy them until staying with Enette’s family. I got in kayak rides last night and today, and had a nice sit on the dock watching the world go by. 

## Bean Hole Days

I slept in a bit this morning then had a nice slow morning sitting around the dining room table with everyone munching on waffles and drinking coffee (a blend of Lindsey’s and Enette’s brews was the winner). Oscar was a very good supervisor of my waffle eating, resting his head on my lap as I ate. 

Yesterday and today are the Bean Hole Days in Pequot Lakes, a couple towns north. They buried large pots of beans yesterday and slowly cooked them underground then today dug them up and served them. Enette and I took the car up while Mike and Marlena biked up. We poked around some, soaking in the small town fair vibes. There was an Elvis impersonator and all. We stopped in downtown Nisswa on the way back and had a beer at the brewery Lindsey works at and checked out a couple of the shops. 

The clouds finally cleared by mid afternoon, so I headed out to the lake. I sat on the dock with Mike, Steve, and Melissa for a bit while Enette paddle boarded with the dogs. Then I took one of the kayaks up the lake the other direction from where Enette and I paddled last night. 

We had grilled burgers/brats/tofu dogs, chips, watermelon, and popcorn for dinner. Lindsey came home from the brewery with a box full of “mystery beers”, which were mis-labeled or dented or otherwise unsellable, which added some fun to the evening. I tried a couple stouts, but didn’t have the courage to try any of the unlabeled beers.
