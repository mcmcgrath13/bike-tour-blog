I slept in this morning and woke up to Fernando making pao de quiejo (little Brazilian cheesey breads) for breakfast. An excellent start to a rest day if you ask me.

Much of the day was spent lounging on the deck out back with Kody and Eggsy (the pups), with a brief intermission in the afternoon to run errands (groceries and REI for a new bungee cord and camp stove fuel). 

After a restful day, doing laundry, dishes, and reorganizing our packs a bit, tomorrow weâ€™ll head into the Adirondacks and say goodbye to Vermont (ðŸ˜¢).
