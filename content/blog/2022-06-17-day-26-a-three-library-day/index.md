Libraries are great places to stop while bike touring. They have bathrooms, water, are inside, quiet, and librarians are lovely folks. Today was a long day in the rain and heat and headwinds, so I escaped into three different libraries throughout the day (a new record for me). 

I got off to an early start a bit before 7am after a big breakfast of waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, yogurt, and chocolate milk. I took a different route out of Port Huron to avoid the main commercial drag, which was much less stressful than the way in. 

Once I got back on route, I was on bike path for about 10 miles, which was a nice quiet way to start the day. The clouds were looming and threatening, and indeed it started to rain part way through and kept going for an hour or two. When I got into a town, I found a carport with a bench in it at a funeral home. A little bit of an odd place for a break, but it was dry and quiet. 

Once I started heading due west (which was the bulk of the mileage today) the headwinds really challenged me. The winds were 15-20mph and just slightly a cross wind too, so my bike was getting pushed around a little in the gusts. It was tiring riding, especially in the sun. 

Thankfully, a bike path appeared around mile 65 for a few miles to provide a shady respite. I took a short second lunch at a picnic table along the path. Today was a day of many short breaks instead of a long lunch. Best to keep moving, otherwise stopping becomes too tempting. 

I made it to Frankenmuth around 5 and enjoyed the Bavarian themed scenery (the whole village is Bavarian themed). I checked into the hotel, cleaned myself up and took myself out to dinner at the brewery across the street. After a long day in the saddle, it was so nice to sit by the river sipping a flight of beers and enjoying bratwurst (when in Rome…), fries, and a salad.
