Four states down, ten-ish to go!

## Goodbye, Vermont

We had one last meal/hagout at Fernando and Randy’s then headed backwards to the ferry (yes, we were so excited to see them that we overshot our route by quite a few miles). 

The ride to the ferry was mostly downhill with a tailwind through quiet country roads. We even biked through a covered bridge. 

We boarded the ferry in Charlotte, VT along with four cars. 

## Hello, New York

The ferry dropped us off in Essex NY marking our fifth state of the trip (for real this timeℹ️). 

As expected, the Adirondacks are hilly. We had a lot of ups and downs into towns along the coast of Lake Champlain, then turned inland for our first big up into the mountains. We made it, though I’m not sure I would have without a rest in Ironville and a three course snack of garlic sesame sticks, beef jerked, and sour patch kids. 

Paradox lake is our camp for the night. Very quiet and pretty, but also quite buggy. 


ℹ️ We had accidentally entered New York a few days earlier for a few miles, but didn’t realize it until VT welcomed us back
