My big activity this rest day was cooking. I love to cook and campground cooking doesn’t quite scratch that itch. I made a vegetable succotash and garlic butter rice to go with MJ and Jason’s grilled meats and then a boatload of fruit trifle for dessert. 

First up in the morning was coffee and lounging in bed, and then coffee and a bagel and lounging on the patio. Amy and Jason also heated up the leftover pizza and fried some eggs to go on them, which was a delicious addition to my breakfast. 

After breakfast, Amy, Jason, Maya and I went on a short hike on their property. MJ elected to read and take a nap instead (she had made it deeper into the day until first nap time than I did on my first rest day). The hike went along an old logging road and then through some field and brush to a slightly steep/rocky section until we crested over the top of a ledge. The view was expansive and breathtaking. You could see all the way up and down the valley for many many miles. We descended down a different path closer to the river and dumping us out by the shed. Amy had lent me a pair of sneakers, which was definitely a good move as there were a lot of briars and prickly things we tromped through, which would not have been as fun in sandles. 

Then it was crossword and coffee time and finally on to the cooking. The recipes I chose involved a lot more prep than true cooking given the hot weather. Some charring of veggies, sautéing the zucchini, and cooking the pudding, but otherwise lots of chopping and assembly. The succotash had charred corn, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, red onion, and black beans with a light vinegar dressing. The trifle had pudding, berries macerated in sparkling rose, whipped cream, and nicely sliced peaches and strawberries for the exterior. I intermingled cooking/prepping and hanging out throughout the day along with the usual rest day activities of staring at maps, charging devices, and literal rest. 

Our evening feast turned out quite well if I do say so myself. All the fresh veggies and fruit and local meat was soooo good after lots of road food the past days. We took a patio and stare at the view break between dinner and dessert. The view does not get old. 

Tomorrow we tackle Sherman Pass. Likely with some leftover trifle to kickstart the day.
