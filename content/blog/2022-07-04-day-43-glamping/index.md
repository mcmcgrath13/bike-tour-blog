While I’ve been camping quite a bit over the past 43 days, it’s been pretty bare bones and often while exhausted after biking all day. Camping with Martha Grace and Kyle has been very much Glamping in comparison. 

I got up in the morning at about eight and made a mug of coffee and sat around in the quiet. Kyle cooked up delicious pancakes and we ate around the fire ring in our camp chairs. We then continued to have a quiet morning hanging around the camp site and chatting. We ate many snacks and snuck in a game when Liam and Izzy were both napping midday. 

After nap time, we headed down to the small pond/beach at the park and the family all swam while I relaxed and started the crossword. Post swim, we hung out some more while Kyle cooked up fajitas for dinner. Dinner was served at the picnic table, surrounded by a big tent and with a table cloth and everything. 

Once the kids were put down for the night, we got a fire going and toasted marshmallows. Followed by more games until adult bed time. 

Tomorrow, we’ll decamp back to Hayward in the morning (but not until after hot breakfast and coffee).
